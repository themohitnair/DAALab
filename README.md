A collection of Design and Analysis of Algorithms Laboratory Programs (ISL46, RITB ISE 2022) 

## Program 1:
Given an array of elements ‘n’, search for an element in this array. Indicate the number of  comparisons for varying values of n. The element to be searched can be the first element, last element, element other than first and last. Assume the number of elements ‘n’, derive a formula to indicate the number of comparisons done.
Use the following search techniques
1. Linear Search
2. Binary search

## Program 2:
Write programs for each of the following and indicate the time complexity for varying values of n. Indicate the parameter ‘n’ and the basic operations.
a. To find the sum of all the elements of the array. (Plot the graph)
b. To find the binary equivalent of a given decimal number. 
c. Read a matrix and print those elements of the matrix that are even.

## Program 3:
The goods packages in a supermarket are assigned an integer label. Write programs to sort the set of goods packages based on label identifier using Bubble Sort and Selection Sort and determine the time required to sort. Plot to compare the time graph. Find its time complexity.

## Program 4:
A library maintains details of N books where every book is assigned a unique ISBN. Develop a program in to sort the books based on ISBN using merge sort technique. Determine the time required to sort. Repeat the experiment for different values of N and plot a graph of the time taken versus N. Find its time complexity.

## Program 5:
Consider a list of ‘n’ files numbered using ID’s. Write a program to sort files based on its ID using Quick sort. Determine the time required to sort the files. Plot a graph of number of IDs versus time taken. Find its time complexity.

## Program 7:
Consider a network of ‘n’ cities which is represented as a Graph. 
a. Write a program to find the transitive closure of such a network using Warshall’s algorithm. 
b. Write a program to find the shortest paths between all cities using Floyd’s algorithm. 
Give the trace of both algorithms. Find its time complexity.
