A collection of Design and Analysis of Algorithms Laboratory Programs (ISL46, RITB ISE 2022).

## Program 1: Linear Search and Binary Search
Given an array of elements ‘n’, search for an element in this array. Indicate the number of comparisons for varying values of n. The element to be searched can be the first element, last element, or an element other than the first and last. Assume the number of elements ‘n’, derive a formula to indicate the number of comparisons done.  
Use the following search techniques:
1. **Linear Search**
2. **Binary Search**

## Program 2: Array Operations
Write programs for each of the following and indicate the time complexity for varying values of n. Indicate the parameter ‘n’ and the basic operations:
- **a.** To find the sum of all the elements of the array. (Plot the graph)
- **b.** To find the binary equivalent of a given decimal number.
- **c.** Read a matrix and print those elements of the matrix that are even.

## Program 3: Sorting Goods Packages
The goods packages in a supermarket are assigned an integer label. Write programs to sort the set of goods packages based on label identifier using **Bubble Sort** and **Selection Sort** and determine the time required to sort. Plot a graph to compare the time complexity.

## Program 4: Merge Sort on Books
A library maintains details of N books where every book is assigned a unique ISBN. Develop a program to sort the books based on ISBN using the **Merge Sort** technique. Determine the time required to sort. Repeat the experiment for different values of N and plot a graph of the time taken versus N. Find its time complexity.
